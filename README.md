# Atomic Weight Calculator

This program asks for a molecular formula in simplified form,
then calculates the total atomic weight of one molecule.
It does NOT calculate molecular weight.

I think it works.  
I took chemistry about a decade ago, so I have no idea what I'm doing.
I also have no idea what I'm doing with Java. I just shoved more if-statements in there until it worked. It's probably a terrible design.

Important:  
Formulas are case-sensitive.  
Multi-character elements must have the
first character upper case, and the second lower case.  
Formulas must have no extra characters. No spaces or symbols.  
No parenthetical expressions.  

Valid Examples:  
HO  
H2O  
HO2  
H2O2  
HeN2Si40PClArBBe12Li
